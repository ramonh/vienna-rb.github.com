### 01/20 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-forty-second edition:

##### [Laura][1]:
- [What is the best programming language for me?][2] - a small and fun questionnaire to find out which programming language is the right one for you
- [Awesome machine learning][3] - A curated list of great machine learning frameworks, libraries, etc.. in different languages. Ruby is in there, too!
- [Contempt Culture][4] - A short article worth reading.

##### [Ramón][5]:
- [101 Ruby Code Factoids][6] - Super neat bite-sized tips and tricks. This counts as 101 picks!

##### [Markus][9]:
- [Programming advice from John Carmack][11] - John Carmack provides adivce and thoughts for beginning programmers. Actually, his advice is pretty good for anyone wanting to learn something new related to programming.
- [Ruby’s “unless X” is processed differently than “if !X”!][10]
- [Postgres 9.5 - the Feature Rundown][12] - PostgreSQL 9.5 was released almost two weeks ago, and Craig Kerstiens provides a great rundown of all the new features. Personally, I'm really hyped about having Upsert.

##### [Lauris][17]:
- [7 ways to decompose fat activerecord models][18] - nice intro into object oriented rails programming
- [anatomy of a rails service object][19] - my favourite article on service objects 
- [activemodel form objects][20] - basic idea of form objects
